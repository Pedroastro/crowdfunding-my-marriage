Welcome to our wedding crowdfunding website! This platform is designed to help us gather support and celebrate our special day with the people we love. Below, you'll find all the information you need to understand how the website works and how you can contribute.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Powers the backend logic, API integration, and server management through Django.
- **Mercado Pago API**: Connects directly to our bank account to pull donation data, providing real-time updates on the progress of contributions.
- **Django**: Serves the website and dynamically updates donation progress.
- **HTML**: Structures the page elements for easy navigation and interaction.
- **CSS**: Beautifies the page layout and includes a stunning progress bar to visually represent our donation goal.
- **JavaScript**: Enhances user experience with features like a button to copy the "PIX" key.

## How It Works

1. **Donation Process**: When you make a donation, the Mercado Pago API securely processes your payment and sends the data to our bank account. Our server pulls this information every time the website is reloaded to update the donation progress in real-time on the website.
2. **PIX Key**: The "PIX" key is a unique identifier used in Brazil's instant payment system. It allows for fast and secure transactions between individuals and businesses. You can copy our PIX key from the website and use it to transfer funds directly to our account.
